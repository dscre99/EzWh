# Informal description
Medium companies and retailers need a simple application to manage the relationship with suppliers and the inventory of physical items stocked in a physical warehouse. 
The warehouse is supervised by a manager, who supervises the availability of items. When a certain item is in short supply, the manager issues an order to a supplier. In general the same item can be purchased by many suppliers. The warehouse keeps a list of possible suppliers per item. 

After some time the items ordered to a supplier are received. The items must be quality checked and stored in specific positions in the warehouse. The quality check is performed by specific roles (quality office), who apply specific tests for item (different items are tested differently). Possibly the tests are not made at all, or made randomly on some of the items received. If an item does not pass a quality test it may be rejected and sent back to the supplier. 

Storage of items in the warehouse must take into account the availability of physical space in the warehouse. Further the position of items must be traced to guide later recollection of them.

The warehouse is part of a company. Other organizational units (OU) of the company may ask for items in the warehouse. This is implemented via Internal Orders, received by the warehouse. Upon reception of an Internal Order the warehouse must collect the requested item(s), prepare them and deliver them to a pick up area. When the item is collected by the other OU the Internal Order is completed. 

EZWH (EaSy WareHouse) is a software application to support the management of a warehouse.

# Glossary

<img src="./RDImages/glossary.png" alt="glossary" width="850">

- **Product**: It is the physical object stored in the warehouse in special shelves used to contain, for each product, a certain number of instances within that particular type. Each product can be associated with an external supplier, a manufacturer, a possible inspection result and a product descriptor.

- **Catalogue**: it contains the list of descriptors of the single products, it does not refer to the single instances but to the common object described by the descriptor. It is useful to describe a product in a generic way within individual orders and is also used by internal orders as a catalog of all possible products contained in the warehouse.

- **Order**: it can be of two types
	- **Internal**: it is issued by an OU employee, it refers to a product inside the warehouse that is deposited by a warehouse worker inside the pickup area.
	- **External**: It is issued by WH manager, it can be of the 2 types normal or return of defective products, it is associated with a shipment carried out by an external delivery company.

	Both types of orders refer to a generic product descriptor, as in the order phase the single instance of the ordered object is not yet known, which will become known once the order is received. 

It is possible to identify different roles to which a particular account is associated with different privileges and contents:
- **Quality inspector**: carries out inspections on individual
- **Warehouse worker**: manages products and internal orders.
- **OU Employee**: place orders within the company.
- **WH Manager**: carries out orders outside the company, accesses product descriptors and manages the warehouse.
- **Consultant agent**: carries out data analysis actions relating to orders
