# Project Estimation

Version:


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed  | 25                                 |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |          800                  | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 20000 | 
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                      2000p/h                |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) |  60000 euro | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |         2000 ph /(4*8)= 12.5 working weeks            |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |

# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
