# Instructions

The design must satisfy the Official Requirements document, notably functional and non functional requirements, and be consistent with the APIs

# High level design 

<discuss architectural styles used, if any>
<report package diagram, if needed>

Architectural style: 

Client server
- data processing is distributed among a set of components 
- we have a set of servers that provides specific services
- we have a set of clients that call these services 
- network allows client to acess servers 
- data is widely distributed 
- requires cheaper hardware for servers, easy add and remove servers, requires network capability
- management is replicated in each server

# Low level design

<for each package in high level design, report class diagram. Each class should detail attributes and operations>









# Verification traceability matrix

\<for each functional requirement from the requirement document, list which classes concur to implement it>











# Verification sequence diagrams 
\<select key scenarios from the requirement document. For each of them define a sequence diagram showing that the scenario can be implemented by the classes and methods in the design>
